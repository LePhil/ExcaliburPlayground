# Install

* npm install
* npm start

Done!


# Currently open:
* finish CutScene stuff (animations, props, ...)
* Sound
* Re-do buttons with Labels. Images are not a solution!
* Upgrades/Events/Penalties!
* * More/less space in inventory
* * More reward per serving
* * Randomly breaking stations? -> got to get Tools/Wrench to fix it before being able to resume using them
* * A way to increase patience of customers
* Use a director or similar object for score/etc. management, *not* a global POJO
* Time should show time (e.g. from 08:00 to 18:00) or at the least count down so it's clear when the time is almost over
